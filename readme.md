# Advent of Code

This repository contains all my attempts to solve the [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com).

I usually use this opportunity to learn myself more about Rust.

## How to use it

### Rust
Install Cargo and simply run `cargo run --bin dayX < data/dayX.in`

### Python
Run `python dayX.py < data/dayX.py
